            <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The History of HTTP</h5>
            <p class="info-body-text">
            In the 1990s, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a network engineer, worked at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
            While working at CERN, Berners-Lee was tasked with creating a solution to a problem that plagued the institution and others: a clean and simple way to store, send, and organize information.
            During this time period, CERN used a number of different instruments, machines, storage devices, and storage methods, causing widespread incompatibility issues.
            Fixing this would be difficult, but Berners-Lee had an idea. Before working at CERN as a network engineer, he had worked as a software consultant for the organization.
            At the time of his role, he created his own software called Enquire. Enquire used the concept of hyperlinks to link different resources within a database.
            Enquire's major flaw was its inability to link over a network. HTTP, in conjuction with other technologies he would develope, set out to fix this weakness. HTTP would become the transport protocol he created, for linking these resources over networks, namly the internet.

            <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Mechanics of HTTP</h5>
            <p class="info-body-text">
            As mentioned before, HTTP is a communication protocol. More specifically, HTTP is a layer 7, or application layer comminucation protocol. 
            Under the hood, HTTP utilizes other protocols like the TCP/IP protocol suite to achieve network communication, though some newer versions used different transpost layer protocols.
            URLs, another technology created by Berners-Lee, are a standard way of communicating at an application level where a resource is. 
            When these URLs are used in conjuction with a web browser to request resources, HTTP works on the backend to provide the resources.
            When using a URL to request a webpage, HTTP requests are made to and from the web server. Both client requests, and server responses are two main parts, a header and a body.
            The header section of either a request or a response stores and sends metadata, or information in relation to the actual requested data. 
            The body section is the payload, or actual information relating to a specific resource that was requested. 
            </p>
            <h5 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Request and Responses</h5>
            <p class="info-body-text">
            The cause of having two seperate types of HTTP messages is due to the design philosophy behind HTTP. HTTP operates on the Client-Server model. 
            The client, makes requests to the server, typically requesting resources. The server, typically serves the client requested resources. 
            Because of this model, technically there are two types of HTTP protocol technologies, client HTTP, or just HTTP, and HTTPd or HTTP daemon. 
            HTTPd is what webserver software is build on top of, and serve requests. 
            Since this model is the basis of how HTTP operates, requests and responses have different anatomies. A HTTP request header includes a method. 
            HTTP methods describe the main underlying function you'd like the server to do on your behalf. Common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and HEAD. 
            Typically outside of GET and POST, the other mentioned methods are used for API's. unlike requests, HTTP server responses send status codes. 
            These status codes allow both software and the user on the client side to get information related to the request. status codes are three digit numbers between 100-599. 
            The left most digit denotes a general response, and the following two digits specify the status further.
            Some common status codes are 400, which mean bad request, 404, which means page not found, 200 which means general success, etc.
